# Contrastive_Learning

This is a mini-project I worked on while studying Contrastive Learning and Self-supervised vision methods. 
I have used the standard ShapeNet dataset, applied 3 different types of augmentations (jittering, shearing, and flipping).
The model used is the DynamicEdgeConv Model.
The Loss function used is NT-Xent
